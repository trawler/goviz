### docker's metrics
goviz has a function which outputs the metrics (instability) of go project.

```
goviz -i github.com/dotcloud/docker/docker -m
```
Instability is a value of 0 to 1.
It suggests that it is such an unstable module that this value is high.
It becomes easy to distinguish whether it is a module nearer to  application layer, and whether it is a module near a common library.
